Q: Why is our data result different than Seattle times?

Results:
--5647 at risk teens 
= sample_size/population ratio * at risk teens
=66,673/2.189 million * 172
where 
sample_size is  total.sql
172 is final_filter.sql
population is a google result

will have data collection bias due to home vs homeless
